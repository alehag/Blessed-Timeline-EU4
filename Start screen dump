    The Great Balkan Empire
   
    Rome was not built in a day. The Great Balkan Empire was nearly not built at all. 
    After centuries of civil war and turbulence, the Kingdom of Slovenia finally reached a moment of success in the early 15th century. 
    With some (a lot, according to some people) of help from the Ruthenians, the Slovenians managed to unite the south Slavic peoples and proclaim the Empire, a goal that had been brewing in the Balkans since the 13th century and the legendary king Koloman the Great. 
  
    In 1444, the Slavs and the Balkan Empire are in a time of tough decisions. In the north, Hungarians and Poles are building strong armies, in the south the new Greek state is becoming a power in its own right, and even though the golden age of Pontus is over, the Pontics is still a power to be feared. 
    Will the Balkan Empire go into a time of stability, or expansion? Can the Ruthenians be trusted to keep their promise of Slavic unity? And above all, why do your kids not even look like you?

    The Tsardom of Ruthenia
    
    The Kievan Rus' have absorbed the small princedoms and duchies that surrounded it during the past few hundred years, using the wealth generated by Kiev's position as a major trading hub to do so. On this day, the 11th of November, 1444, the King in Kiev has, with the blessing of the Orthodox Patriarch, declared himself Caesar, Tsar, of all the Russias.
    
    But the Tsardom has plenty of enemies. To the south, the remains and successor states of the great kingdom of Pontus pose a threat to Ruthenian ambitions in the Caucasus. To the west lies the √çslandic Fylkirate, a federation of Norse statelets that has been a thorn in the Ruthenian side for a century, as well as the Holy Roman Empire, a realm whose ruler is sure to see the Ruthenian ambitions on the Imperial title as a threat to their legitimacy. In the east, remnants of the Great Mongol Horde of the 13th century still ravage the countryside.
    
    Ruthenia is not entirely without friends, however. Though Ruthenia may see the Great Balkan Empire as a troublesome stepchild for all the internal conflict they have had to sort out for them, they remain steadfast friends under the guise of slavic unity - for now, at least. There has also ever been a friend in the kingdom of Arles, but as cracks have begun to show in their ability to hold the realm together, who knows how long that will last?
