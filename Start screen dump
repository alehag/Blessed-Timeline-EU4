    "The Great Balkan Empire \n\nRome was not built in a day. The Great Balkan Empire was nearly not built at all. \n\nAfter centuries of civil war and turbulence, the Kingdom of Slovenia finally reached a moment of success in the early 15th century. With some (a lot, according to some people) of help from the Ruthenians, the Slovenians managed to unite the south Slavic peoples and proclaim the Empire, a goal that had been brewing in the Balkans since the 13th century and the legendary king Koloman the Great. \n\nIn 1444, the Slavs and the Balkan Empire are in a time of tough decisions. In the north, Hungarians and Poles are building strong armies, in the south the new Greek state is becoming a power in its own right, and even though the golden age of Pontus is over, the Pontics is still a power to be feared. \n\nWill the Balkan Empire go into a time of stability, or expansion? Can the Ruthenians be trusted to keep their promise of Slavic unity? And above all, why do your kids not even look like you?"

    "The Tsardom of Ruthenia \n\nThe Kievan Rus' have absorbed the small princedoms and duchies that surrounded it during the past few hundred years, using the wealth generated by Kiev's position as a major trading hub to do so. On this day, the 11th of November, 1444, the King in Kiev has, with the blessing of the Orthodox Patriarch, declared himself Caesar, Tsar, of all the Russias. \n\nBut the Tsardom has plenty of enemies. To the south, the remains and successor states of the great kingdom of Pontus pose a threat to Ruthenian ambitions in the Caucasus. To the west lies the Íslandic Fylkirate, a federation of Norse statelets that has been a thorn in the Ruthenian side for a century, as well as the Holy Roman Empire, a realm whose ruler is sure to see the Ruthenian ambitions on the Imperial title as a threat to their legitimacy. In the east, remnants of the Great Mongol Horde of the 13th century still ravage the countryside. \n\nRuthenia is not entirely without friends, however. Though Ruthenia may see the Great Balkan Empire as a troublesome stepchild for all the internal conflict they have had to sort out for them, they remain steadfast friends under the guise of slavic unity - for now, at least. There has also ever been a friend in the kingdom of Arles, but as cracks have begun to show in their ability to hold the realm together, who knows how long that will last?"

    "The Kingdom of Bohemia and Moravia \n\nHidden behind the mountains of the Sudetes in the east lies the small but historically powerful kingdom of Bohemia and Moravia. Its ruling family, the Hapsburgs, have ruled the region since at least the 9th century, and for several centuries held the title of Holy Roman Emperors. That title, and most of the land they held alongside it, such as the archduchies of Germany, Italy, Austria and Bavaria, have long since been lost to the Hapsburg kings. So furious were they when they were cast from the throne of the Empire that they effectively seceded. \n\nUntil now, that is. The turmoil that has befallen the kingdoms around Europe the past few decades has splintered the Ruthenians in the east, the Íslandic fylkirate in the north, both the Sicilians and the Pontics in the south and the Arlesians in the west. And so the Bohemians have re-entered the fold of the Holy Roman Empire, seeking security, or perhaps to one day claim the throne again? \n\nStill, it is a whole new Empire they come into. The Thungaringians have grown ever mightier to the north, and the Frisians sit at the Atlantic fringe of the empire, bathing in gold from the rich trade flowing into Honkerdam. \n\nAs if that's not enough, these past few decades have seen the common people turn more and more to the teachings of the preacher Jan Hus and his Hussite brand of christianity. By all reports, some sort of uprising is brewing. \n\nWhat does this mean for the ancient kingdom of Bohemia?"

	"The Caliphate of Andalusia \n\nAfter the battle of Poiters in 732, one could have believed that the Muslim expansion into Europe would go into a decline. Although this was true for the first centuries following the wars against Charles Martel, in the 11th and 12th century the Islam powers of Iberia started to unite under the fearful Sumadid banner, ecpecially under the rule of of Jyad Ibn Yahya in the early 12th century. \n\n	From this point, the Andalusians became a great European power, not only in terms of military might, but also in art, science and city building. \n\nIn the Catalonian Wars, a conflict against the archrival Arles that raged for 200 years, as well as the wars of the numerous Sicilies, the Andalusians got to show that they were indeed a force to be reckoned with. \n\nIn 1444, the Caliphate of the West is at a crossroad – the path to the east is a path of war, with the kingdoms of the Mediterranean sharpening their swords and hoisting their sails – or… has the time come for the great Muslim seafearers to answer the eternal question: \“What lies beyond that western horizon?\""

	"The Kingdom of Frisia \n\n	History is a delicate fabric of events, decisions and a bit of luck. Through the centuries, the Holy Roman Empire got to feel the weight of HONK (wait what?) history, mostly in a negative way. \n\nThe HONK (please no) chaotic legacy of Charlemange was a smorgasbord of power grabbing and HONK internal struggle, with enemies around HONK every corner. One of the HONK powers that rose from this HONK was the HONK kingdom of Frisia. With it’s HONK (oh dear they’re getting closer). As said, history is a delicate HONK HONK (tell my family I love them) fabric of events HONK HONK HONK (AAAAAAARRRRGHHHH) \n\nHONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK HONK"

		"The Kingdom of Arles \n\n 'A guèrra!' Through the middle ages, the Occitan warcry could be heard in all the corners of the west, and the lands that heard it, seldom lived to tell the tale. \n\nBy cunning planning, warmaking, and the joy of cooking food over a warm bed of coal, the Pâturage et Montagne family managed to establish a kingdom – first within the Holy Roman Empire – and then outside the Holy Roman Empire. \n\nBy the mid 15th century the kingdom had, as well as many of their rulers, grown to be comically large. But the memories and scars of the Great Crusades (1430-1440) is still a trauma for the region, and has left its lands unstable. \n\nThe west now asks, will the kingdom of Arles continue to be a dominant force in Europe, or will the giant collapse under its own weight?"
